# Stress and Affect Detection on Resource-Constrained Devices

This repository contains code for the paper "Stress and Affect Detection on Resource-Constrained Devices", presented at the 18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (2019), Boca Raton, FL, USA.

We discuss an efficient and accurate solution to stress detection in our paper. The datasets used are:
* WESAD
* SWELL-KW
* DREAMER

Paper published in Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (2019), IEEE Xplore.
